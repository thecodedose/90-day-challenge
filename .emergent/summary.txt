The AI engineer successfully built The 90-Day Lock-In Challenge application, progressing from initial authentication setup to a comprehensive suite of features. The development was iterative, heavily relying on user feedback to refine functionalities and design. Key milestones included integrating Emergent Google OAuth, implementing project management CRUD operations, and developing a dynamic dashboard with a 90-day tracker. UI/UX was significantly enhanced with a glassmorphism dark theme. Subsequent additions involved public user profiles, a detailed daily journal with an interactive heatmap, and a customizable, pizza-themed Pomodoro timer. The engineer meticulously addressed security concerns, corrected logical errors like day calculation, and consistently refined the user interface. The current work focuses on a visual enhancement for the Pomodoro timer, transitioning to an image-based pizza visualization.

The 90-Day Lock-In Challenge application helps web developers track their progress and maintain focus over a 90-day period. Key features developed include:
1.  **Authentication:** Secure Google OAuth via Emergent Auth for user login and session management.
2.  **Project Management:** Users can create, view, edit, and delete projects (title, description, tech stack, links) associated with their account.
3.  **Dashboard & Timeline:** A personalized dashboard displays user projects and a fixed 90-day challenge timeline, accurately calculating the current day from October 9, 2025.
4.  **Explore Page:** A public project showcase with immediate link visibility, total project count, and sticky filtering by tech stack.
5.  **User Profile Pages:** Public profiles displaying a user's projects, journal entries, and heatmap, accessible by clicking creator names. A private banner informs logged-in users they are viewing their public profile.
6.  **Daily Journal:** Users can add/edit daily journal entries (title, mood, content) for any challenge day, appearing on their profile.
7.  **Journal Heatmap:** A GitHub-style activity heatmap visualizes journaling consistency, grouped into three 30-day sections, with mood-based colors and clickable cells for entry management. The layout is a 1x3 grid.
8.  **Pizza Pomodoro Timer:** A customizable study timer with a pizza theme. Completing 25-minute focus sessions unlocks pizza slices, aiming for a full pizza (4 sessions). The visualization is being transitioned to use a user-provided pizza image.
9.  **Consistent UI:** A dark-themed glassmorphism design with a uniform navigation header including a Discord community link.

<current_work>
The AI engineer is currently working on enhancing the Pizza Pomodoro Timer by changing its visualization. The user explicitly requested to use a pizza image sliced into sectors instead of the previously implemented SVG-based circular sectors.

Before this request, the timer featured a visually appealing SVG pizza with distinct sectors that would fill up upon session completion. The current effort involves integrating a real pizza image for this visualization. The engineer had started by fetching pizza images using  and then began modifying the  component () and  to handle image-based sector revealing. This process involves complex polygon clipping calculations to correctly display slices of the image.

The last action in the trajectory was the user providing a specific pizza image () via artifact upload, and the AI engineer confirming the intent to use this image for the visualization. The product's Pomodoro timer currently has the foundation for visual progress, but the transition to an image-based, sector-revealing pizza is ongoing, with the new image now available for implementation.
